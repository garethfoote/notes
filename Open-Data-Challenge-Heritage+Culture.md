## Top level ideas for adoption (from Hackpad or UsCreates report)
* [HACKPAD] Services to help institutions bring their content to an audience beyond the four walls of the museum or gallery - with the cost of travel and time being a significant barrier for some users, participants in our stakeholder research have suggested that an opportunity exists to bring heritage and cultural content into school classrooms and peopleâ€™s living rooms through a new product or service. 

## Exisiting ideas
* Philly art finder. For murals and public art. https://vimeo.com/31459101
	* May have appeal to people who don't usually visit museums/gallerys
	* Perhaps taking cultural artifacts out of institutional context is good for wider engagement

## Own ideas (Top level)
* Not too screen-centric. IRL.
* Educationally focussed using Linked Data to extract relevant objects, narratives and connections between database nodes.

## Own ideas (Nitty gritty)
* Art culture bot. Using AI and linked data. Something funny, irreverant. Existing Art Meme bot:
http://technical.ly/baltimore/2014/01/27/art-bytes-2014/  & https://twitter.com/ArtMeme14  
* Virtual/online geocaching. Using objects which have location data and users location to push information about objects, events, people that have connection to current location. Collection activity. (How to expand this?)

## Judging Criteria

http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/open-data-challenge-series/judging-criteria

* Innovation
Projects will be judged on whether they represent a substantive new and innovative contribution. We are looking for completely new products, technologies, or services or improvements to existing solutions, combining or implementing these in new ways.

* Likely societal (social, environmental or economic) impact in relation to the challenge problem
Projects will be judged on the extent to which they can demonstrate how they would have a concrete social impact in relation to the challenge problem. 

* Extent of use of open data and how effectively this has been incorporated into the project
Projects will be judged on their use of open data, in particular:
	* the extent to which it is incorporated into their product / service, and
	* how effectively it is used in the service, and in relation to criteria 1, whether this is an innovative use of open data
	* the extent to which new open data sources are generated as a (by)product of their project
 ** You must also include at least one source of government open data in your submission.**

* Potential market for, and sustainability of, an ongoing business
Projects will be judged on how well they have tailored their product or service to a potential market and how well they have understood the opportunities in this market. The extent to which teams can show the potential and/or specific opportunity for growth and the development of a sustainable business model will also be considered. Whether the solutions are easy to understand and affordable for consumers will also be taken into consideration.
