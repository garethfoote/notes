Developed an idea for a company (Algae Coin) that sells Algae cultivating tanks. Targeting hobbyists, science enthusiasts and environmentally minded. Algae is then harvested and given back to the business to create products (fuel, food, plastic products) that are then available to harvesters depending on the success of their crop.
